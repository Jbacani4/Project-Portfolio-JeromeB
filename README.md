# Project-Portfolio-JeromeB

Basic starting portfolio with plenty of room to expand in the future. In this ReadMe file I will go over and outline the creating of the components: Home, About, Projects, Navbar, footer and contact. As well as the overall skeletal contruction of the project.

# Skeleton

Overall I struggled mainly with my creativity on this project. I settled with something simple and easy to work with as well as using very contrasting colour scheme. Dark tone back ground with pink accent. Generally pleasing to the eyes and getting the main messages accross. Beauty in simplicity.

# Home

The 'hero' section where users are first greeted to when entering this portfolio. Gets my name, where am I and my language proficiencies out the way as well as some key links. The goal in mind was this section to really be there hero and ultimately someone can gain just enough information on my right away plain and simply.

# About

The about section is basically kind of an extention of the home section, follows a more in depth description on who I am as a person and a photo of myself.

# Contact

Here is a very basic contact page that include all my socials with my email and phone number included. It is the last page where users/recruiters after diving in on the sections before can easily reach me.

# Projects

A page displaying the projects I worked on this course. It contains screenshot representation of the app live that is interactable that links to the project itself. Simple hover back shadow when cursor is over it. I chose to display the Nyan cat and tictactoc game. Just like the portfolio itself, the projects are being hosted on vercel.

# Navbar

This is probably the section i spent the most time in as I struggled with its formatting. Originally I had a simple navbar 'Home, About, Projects, Contact' that persisted on the top through all the sections with 'links' to all other sections. However i found that even with just 4 sections it still felt to crowded for me on mobile. I had the idea to create a hamburger menu on the top corner, not only for mobile, but on desktop browser at a certain size breakpoint, the navbar will turn into a hamburger menu aswell.

# Footer

Almost an extention of my contact section. Like the Navbar, my footer is persistent throughout my portfolio except it displays my social media links. I've also included a copyright notice displaying my ownership of the portfolio.
